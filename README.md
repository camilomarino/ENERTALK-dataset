# ENERTALK-dataset
**The ENERTALK Dataset, 15 Hz Electricity Consumption Data from 22 Houses in Korea**

This repository contains jupyter notebooks for plots in the ENERTALK dataset paper. In order to visualize figures using notebooks, the 'ENERTALK' dataset must be downloaded first.

## Requirements
Listed in `requirements.txt`. Install with `pip install -r
requirements.txt`

## Data
After acquiring the
data and running the setup scripts your folder structure should look
like
